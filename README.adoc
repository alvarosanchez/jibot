= jibot

Jibot is a tiny HipChat add-on that listen for JIRA keys being mentioned on a room, and sends back the link for them plus
some additional info

It receives webhook notifications from HipChat when a message is sent to a room. It compares the message against your
JIRA project key pattern, and if it matches, it queries the JIRA REST API to fetch the details of the issue(s). If
anything found, it sends back to the room few details about the issue(s).

CAUTION: JIRA REST API authentication sucks. They basically support HTTP Basic Auth or OAuth 1.0a. Ideally, to avoid
passwords being stored, OAuth should be used. However, that complicates a lot the setup of the add-on (you have to
preconfigure it on JIRA) and the development of Jibot itself. That's why I provide the full source code so you can
run Jibot on your server.
